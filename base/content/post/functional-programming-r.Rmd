Functional programming is a style of programming that focuses on data transformations and calculations, rather than objects and state.




```{r}
CompPerAtt <- function(comp, att) {
  
}

YdsPerAtt <- function(yds, att) {
  
}

TdPerAtt <- function(td, att) {
  
}

IntPerAtt <- function(int, att) {
  
}

PasserRating <- function() {
  
}
```

```{r}

```
