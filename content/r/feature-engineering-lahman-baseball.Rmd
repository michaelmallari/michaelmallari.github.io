The Lahman Baseball Database (version 8.0-0) is a collection of pitching, hitting, fielding, and other data from 1871 to 2019.  (This includes Jacob deGrom's Cy Young Award-winning seasons with the New York Mets in 2018 and 2019!)

## Import the Lahman Baseball Database

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_version("Lahman", version = "8.0-0", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(Lahman)
```

## Exploring the Data

```{r}
Lahman::LahmanData
```


## Joining Data

In the real world, data sets typically come split across many tables. As we can see above, that is certainly true for the Lahman Baseball Databaseâ€”split up across many data frames.  In order to apply feature engineering techniques, we must first join the data (essentially reversing the efficiencies of relationship databases).
